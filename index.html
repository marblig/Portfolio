      <h2>üìú How I got here...</h2>
      <p>
        At the end of 2019 I was unsatisfied with my work and looking for a new job. With the help of a friend I
        discovered coding and was immediately hooked. Since then, after many months of study and practice, I have
        decided to make this new passion my next career, and at the end of 2021 I enrolled at JustIT in order to take
        the next step and find my first job as a developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        With over ten years of experience as a chef, working in a variety of professional kitchens, I have developed a
        strong set of practical skills and a wealth of knowledge regarding teamwork, organisation, and working to strict
        deadlines. Being a quick learner, I have found that I am able to understand and implement new languages and
        technologies almost immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        My current goal is to become established in a role as a junior developer or apprentice and work with talented
        individuals from whom I can learn as much as possible during the following, crucial years of my development.
        Having just graduated from the JustIT bootcamp, I am currently working on new projects while looking for my first
        job as a developer, and I thought the best place to do that would be a cube in space &#127762;&#10024;
